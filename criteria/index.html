							<h3>Appropriate Size</h3>
							<p><strong>Phoenix Strategy targets controlling interests in companies with a total enterprise value below $20 million</strong>, or consolidation opportunities with comparable total transaction value. However, we have partnered with other Private Equity firms to acquire companies of larger size.</p>
							<h3>Established Enterprises</h3>
							<p><strong>Businesses with an established history of operations</strong> are strongly preferred to recently established businesses. We do not invest in start-up companies.</p>
							<h3>Industry</h3>
							<p><strong>We seek businesses where we can bring knowledge and experience to the table.</strong> Therefore, we are focused on companies in manufacturing/engineering, value added distribution, consumer services, business services, health and wellness, financial services, marketing services, or franchising. We also have extensive experience with real estate, and though we are not focused on pure real estate plays, we would be open to businesses that own real estate as part of their overall business activity.</p>
							<h3>Company</h3>
							<p><strong>We prefer a strong market position, competitive niche and/or a brand which enables the company to have a clear and sustainable value proposition.</strong> We also prefer a low threat of technical obsolescence. We do not mind companies that are currently underperforming or that have hit a rough patch due to internal or external forces in their history.</p>
							<h3>Geography</h3>
							<p>Each of the Phoenix partners focuses on companies and investments in their respective geographic area of the country, but each partner will look and all companies that can be moved or that can support a dual headquarter.</p>
							<p><strong>Mike Zani</strong> &#8211; prefers businesses with headquarters or substantial operational presence in the North East U.S.</p>
							<p><strong>Daniel Muzquiz</strong> &#8211; prefers businesses with headquarters or substantial operational presence in the South Central, U.S.</p>
							<p><strong>David Schnabel</strong> &#8211; prefers businesses with headquarters or substantial operational presence in the South or West coasts of the U.S.</p>
