							<p><strong>We relocate to an acquired company to join the remaining senior management team in an acquired firm. This differs substantially from the vast majority of private equity groups in the market.</strong> We do fewer deals and work side-by-side in operating roles with the management team. This enables us to invest in situations with a current or projected management vacuum &#8212; e.g. an owner-operator who wishes to retire shortly after sale or an estate/probate sale.</p>
							<p>We invest in companies where we can obtain a controlling interest and assume day-to-day management. We focus on smaller (&#60;$20 million total enterprise value) businesses in the industries we know best. While a number of situations may lead to a good investment opportunity, we believe our unique resources position us well to invest in any of the following:</p>
							<ol class="alpha">
								<li>Leadership succession opportunities where an owner/operator is looking to transition to a new role or retire</li>
								<li>Companies that are currently underperforming, thereby requiring capital and/or management leadership</li>
								<li>Divestitures, carve-outs or spin-outs</li>

								<p><strong>In searching for acquisition candidates, Phoenix Strategy relies heavily on investment bankers, business brokers, accountants, lenders, and attorneys to help us find good investment opportunities.</strong> We enjoy positive and mutually rewarding relationships with these intermediaries, and we work hard to be considerate, confidential, and responsive.</p>
								<p>Phoenix strives to be as transparent as possible through the acquisition process. We understand how difficult a sale can be for existing owners and other stakeholders. Once we have learned of an opportunity and come to understand it at a high level, we will make a preliminary indication of our interest and inform the seller, or intermediary, as appropriate.</p>
								<p>We then initiate in-depth due diligence, including conducting market research; assessing business and market conditions, management, products, competition, customers and vendors; developing financial models; and benchmarking performance against industry peers. Phoenix Strategy's evaluation of an acquisition candidate is on a confidential basis and takes into account issues such as employee welfare and an owner's tax planning.</p>
								<p>Following detailed due diligence, Phoenix will negotiate investment terms, develop a financial and ownership structure, contact potential lenders (as, or if, needed), and submit a letter of intent. After mutually agreeing on the terms of the transaction, the final step is documentation and funding of the transaction.</p>
								<p>After the transaction is complete, Phoenix Strategy works to smoothly transition the existing owner with minimal disruptions for customers, employees, and suppliers. Our management team takes over day-to-day operations of the business, and members of the investor team actively participate on the Board of Directors or as informal advisors to the company.</p>
