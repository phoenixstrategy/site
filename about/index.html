							<p><strong>Phoenix Strategy is an entrepreneurial investment company formed to acquire and operate a small to medium sized privately-held business.</strong> Our principals take day-to-day operating roles in every investment we make. As a result, we invest in fewer companies and have a longer term perspective at building businesses.</p>
							<p>Phoenix was built by people who know how to manage people and run businesses. Our goal is to provide an attractive liquidity option for business owners by working closely with them to structure a transaction that best meets their financial and personal objectives. Once acquired, we step in to manage the day-to-day operations of the company. This unique approach is ideal for those owners who would like to completely step away from management responsibilities or assume a lesser role within the company.</p>
